# Laboratory Glassware Inventory Tracker

#### By Jonathan Cheng

#### This web application is an inventory tracker for laboratory glassware. The user can add item entries representing a specific piece of laboratory glassware with properties such as name, type, volume (how much the glassware can store), and quantity (number of this specific glassware the lab is in possession of). The user may choose to edit entries or delete them entirely. The list will be updated to reflect any changes.

## Description

_This app is the result of a day long individual project to demonstrate understanding of introduction to React fundamental concepts. I use create-react-app for a quick React set up -- SPA (single page application). My planning of the project -- of how the components are organized -- is depicted in the screenshot below, labeled "Component Diagram". I use one class component (ItemControl) to store state and to update all state changes. The rest of the components are functional and do not directly manipulate state._
